  "body": "http-proxy-server\r\n=================\r\n\r\nA Very Basic Proxy Server. (Multi Threaded)\r\n\r\nTo Compile:\r\n\t$ javac ProxyServer.java\r\n\r\nTo Run:\r\n\t$ ./main <port no.> <proxy-1/no_proxy-0> proxy is a proxy server running in intranet of our campus i.e \"proxy.iiit.ac.in\"\r\n\teg. $ java ProxyServer 9000 1\r\n\r\n\r\nTo use telnet:\r\n\t$ telnet 127.0.0.1 9000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSample Request\r\n==============\r\n\r\nAfter running the proxy server at the given port (say 9000), open a new terminal and type\r\n\r\n$ telnet 127.0.0.1 9000\r\nto connect to proxy server\r\nthen type in the following sample request\r\n\r\nGET http://wikihow.com HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n<two enters to end the request>\r\n\r\nOutput will be in the terminal\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT POINTS TO REMEMBER:\r\n============================\r\n\r\nConfiguring a Web Browser to Use a Proxy:\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nFirefox:\r\n\r\nSelect Tools->Options (or Edit->Preferences) from the menu.\r\nClick on the 'Advanced' icon in the Options dialog.\r\nSelect the 'Network' tab, and click on 'Settings' in the 'Connections' area.\r\nSelect 'Manual Proxy Configuration' from the options available. In the boxes, enter the hostname and port where proxy program is running.\r\n\r\nConfiguring Firefox to use HTTP/1.0\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nBecause Firefox defaults to using HTTP/1.1 and your proxy speaks HTTP/1.0, there are a couple of minor changes that need to be made to Firefox's configuration. Fortunately, Firefox is smart enough to know when it is connecting through a proxy, and has a few special configuration keys that can be used to tweak the browser's behavior.\r\n\r\nType 'about:config' in the title bar.\r\nIn the search/filter bar, type 'network.http.proxy'\r\nYou should see three keys: network.http.proxy.keepalive, network.http.proxy.pipelining, and network.http.proxy.version.\r\nSet keepalive to false. Set version to 1.0. Make sure that pipelining is set to false.\r\n\r\n",
